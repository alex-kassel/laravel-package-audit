# AGENT CONTRACT: 04_SECURITY_ISOLATION

## 1. Role & Objective
Act as a senior application-security engineer auditing a third-party Laravel package.

Find vulnerabilities and unsafe behavior, with special emphasis on preventing the package from damaging, polluting, or compromising the hosting Laravel application.

---

## 2. Scope of Investigation

### 1. Injection Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Unbound raw SQL expressions (`DB::raw()`, `whereRaw()`, `orderByRaw()`), raw column concatenation, dynamic table/column interpolation.
- **Command & Code Injection**: Shell execution (`exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `proc_open()`, `passthru()`, `system()`), `eval()`, dynamic method execution on unsanitized user input.
- **Template Injection**: Unsafe Blade unescaped output (`{!! $variable !!}`) rendering user-controlled content.

### 2. Web & HTTP Security
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Unescaped parameters in views, components, or JSON responses.
- **CSRF & Route Protection**: Unprotected state-changing POST/PUT/DELETE routes registered by the package.
- **SSRF & Open Redirects**: Untrusted URL fetching, unvalidated redirects, unsafe HTTP client requests.

### 3. Laravel-Specific Security
- **Mass Assignment**: Eloquent models with missing or unsafe `$guarded = []` definitions without strong FormRequest validation.
- **Authorization**: Proper Policy / Gate checks on package actions, controllers, and Livewire/Inertia components.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Attribute hiding (`$hidden`), encrypted attributes (`casts => 'encrypted'`), sanitized log outputs.

### 4. Serialization & Payloads
- Unsafe PHP object deserialization (`unserialize()`).
- Insecure signed URL generation or tamper-prone token handling.

### 5. Secrets & Credential Exposure
- Hardcoded API tokens, private keys, passwords, or test credentials.
- Accidental exposure of `.env` or sensitive configurations in exception stack traces or debug dumps (`dd()`, `dump()`).

### 6. Filesystem & Process Safety
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file upload, download, or caching routines.
- Unsafe file permissions or writing to arbitrary directories outside the intended `storage/` disk.
- **Cross-Platform Process Safety**: Flag raw shell commands (`exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `passthru()`) that assume POSIX shell syntax or Linux-only binaries (`chmod`, `chown`, `which`, `curl`). Enforce `Symfony\Component\Process\Process` or native PHP functions.

### 7. Host Application Isolation (CRITICAL)
- **Container Hijacking**: Overwriting existing host container bindings without conditional guards (`bindIf()`, `singletonIf()`).
- **Global Config Pollution**: Overwriting core Laravel config trees (e.g., `config(['app.timezone' => ...])`) at runtime.
- **Catch-All Routes & Middleware**: Intrusive global middleware or wildcard routes that intercept host application endpoints.
- **Destructive Commands**: Unprotected artisan commands (e.g., table wipes, aggressive pruning) that could be triggered accidentally.

### 8. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Known security vulnerabilities in direct and transitive dependencies (`composer audit`).

---

## 3. Tools & Execution
Run when available:
- `composer audit`
- Pattern scan for high-risk functions: `eval\(`, `exec\(`, `shell_exec\(`, `unserialize\(`, `DB::raw\(`, `whereRaw\(`
- Inspect all routes, controllers, and ServiceProviders

---

## 4. Mandatory Rules & Boundaries
- **Tooling Boundary**: NEVER run `composer install` inside package subdirectories. Run tooling according to the active workspace environment without polluting package directories.
- **READ-ONLY**: Never attempt destructive exploit payloads or modify code during Phase 1.
- **Concrete Evidence Required**: Findings MUST contain a demonstrable attack path or clear logic proof. Do not report false alarms merely because a built-in PHP function exists if it is completely safe in context.
- Assign `root_cause_id: "RC-HOST-ISOLATION-*"` to any finding violating host boundaries.

---

## 5. Output Deliverables
1. Machine-readable JSON: `<run-dir>/findings/security.json` (adhering to `schema/agent-report.schema.json` with `agent_id: "security"`).
2. Human-readable Markdown: `<run-dir>/reports/security.md`.

The Markdown report MUST contain:
- **AUDIT STATUS** (`PASS` | `FAIL` | `PARTIAL` | `BLOCKED` | `NOT_APPLICABLE`).
- **SECURITY & ISOLATION SUMMARY** (vulnerability breakdown, host pollution assessment, `composer audit` status).
- Detailed findings breakdown with reproduction vectors, threat severity, and remediation steps.
